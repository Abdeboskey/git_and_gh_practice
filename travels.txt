This past summer, I had the amazing opportunity to go on tour in Bali, Indonesia with a Balinese Gamelan orchestra that I have played with here in Denver, CO for the past 9 years.
This was my 4th time in Bali, but was a very unique experience traveling with the entire group from Denver, and connecting with so many Balinese people
through sharing in their traditional art. We worked incredibly hard to prepare for this experience, we were very well received, and it was a
powerful bonding experience for the group.
